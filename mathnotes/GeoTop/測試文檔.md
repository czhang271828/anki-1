## 同構第一定理

What is isomorphism theorem A?

%

Let $𝒞$ be any good $🐱$ with $\ker$,
$\mathrm{im}$, well-powered, etc. Let
$U \overset φ → V$ be any morphism.
The canonical morphism

$$
U / \mathrm{ker}(φ) =: \mathrm{coim}(φ) → \mathrm{im}(φ), \ [x]_{\ker(φ)}↦ φ (x)
$$

is an isomorphism.

## 同構第二定理

What is isomorphism theorem B?

%

Let $𝒞$ be any good $🐱$ with $\ker$,
$\mathrm{im}$, well-powered, etc. Let
$U$ and $V$ be sub-objects of $X$. The
canonical morphism

$$
\frac{U + V}{U} → \frac{V}{U ∩ V}, \ [u+v]_{U} ↦ [v]_{U ∩ V}
$$

is an isomorphism.

## 同構第三定理

What is isomorphism theorem C?

%

Let $𝒞$ be any good $🐱$ with $\ker$,
$\mathrm{im}$, well-powered, etc. Let
$U$ be a sub-object of $V$ and $V$ be
a sub-object of $W$, i.e. $U ↪ V ↪ W$.
The canonical morphism

$$
\frac{W / U}{V / U} → W / V, \ [w+U]_{V/U} ↦ [w]_V
$$

is an isomorphism.

## 同構第四定理

What is isomorphism theorem D?

%

Let $𝒞$ be any good $🐱$ with $\ker$,
$\mathrm{im}$, well-powered, etc.
Assume $U$ be a sub-object of $V$.
Then there is a bijection between

$$
\{A ∈ 🐱∣ U ⊆ A ⊆ V\} → \{B ∈ 🐱 ∣ B ⊆  V/ U\},
$$

via the quotient morphism $A ↦ A/U$.

## Infinite Life theorem

What is Stock's integral formula?

%

Taking $🐸$ and $⏳$ by convention,
one has

$$
∫ _{∂ 🐸} ⏳ = ∫ _{🐸} \operatorname d ⏳ = + ∞.
$$
